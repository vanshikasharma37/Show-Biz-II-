            <p>I gained valuable insights into web development practices, particularly in using ASP.NET for building dynamic web applications. I learned how to implement features such as rich text editing and media uploads, which enhanced my understanding of handling user input and managing data effectively. Additionally, I became familiar with the concept of bundling and minification, which are essential for optimizing web performance by reducing load times. Working with Entity Framework migrations taught me how to manage database schema changes seamlessly, ensuring that my application remains functional as I add new features.</p>

            <h2 id="whatIStruggledWith">I struggled with ...</h2>
            <p>I encountered several challenges that tested my problem-solving skills. One significant issue was related to database migrations; after adding new properties to my model classes, I faced errors when trying to update the database schema, which required careful attention to the migration commands and ensuring that the context was properly configured. Additionally, integrating rich text editing functionality proved to be tricky, as I had to ensure that the CKEditor was correctly referenced and initialized in my views, which involved troubleshooting JavaScript errors. I also struggled with the media upload feature, particularly in handling different file types and ensuring that the application could process and display them correctly.</p>
